I will edit the README as this project nears completation and usability for anyone who wants to download the app.

#Goals

Learn React Native, which should give me an easy transistion to using React since I'm aware of how to make websites from Ruby on Rails.

Develop an app similar to the Stronglifts 5x5 app. The App is fine but there are too many popups and some smaller adjustments I would make to it if I could.

Learn how to create and publish my first Android app to the Google Play Store.
