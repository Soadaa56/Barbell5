I will edit the README as this project nears completation and usability for anyone who wants to download the app.

#Goals

Learn React Native, which should give me an easy transistion to using React since I'm aware of how to make websites from Ruby on Rails.

Learn how to create and publish my first Android app that I personally will get some use out of it, which will make spotting any bugs easier.
